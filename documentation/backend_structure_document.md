Thanks for the detailed summary—it’s comprehensive and gives me everything I need to draft the step-by-step implementation guide for the front end. Before I proceed, here are a couple quick questions just to be sure:

1. Assets & File Organization
   • Do you have a preferred folder structure beyond placing PDFs and slide decks in `/public`?  
   • Should we organize JSON metrics under a specific directory (e.g., `/data`)?

2. Environment & Deployment
   • Any environment-specific variables (even if minimal), like analytics IDs, you want stubbed out in `.env.local`?  
   • Should I include example Netlify config (`netlify.toml`)?

3. Future Integrations (Deferred)
   • For email capture/checklist, do you want a placeholder service (e.g., Formspree) included or purely stub functions?  

If none of these need further detail, I’m ready to jump in and outline the step-by-step guide. Let me know!
