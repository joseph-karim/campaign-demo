# Closing the Cognitive Assessment Gap App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new visitor lands on the app URL or clicks through from an advertisement or email link, they arrive directly on the public interactive report page without needing to create an account or sign in. There is no traditional authentication system, and all content remains accessible by default. When users click on any call-to-action that offers a downloadable resource, a lightweight modal appears requesting their email address. After entering a valid email, the requested PDF or asset link is presented instantly for download. No password or login is required, and users can close the modal at any time to return to the page. Because there is no persistent account or profile, there is no sign-out, password recovery, or profile management flow.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Upon arrival, the visitor sees a clean header bearing the Creyos logo on the top left and a sticky persona selector at the top of the viewport. This selector allows choosing between Primary Care, Neurology, Mental Health / ADHD, or Corporate Wellness. As soon as the visitor makes a selection, the hero headline, subhead text, visuals, and calls to action throughout the page update immediately without full page reload. Below the header, the hero section features a bold H1 reading “You’re missing cognitive problems you can’t afford to miss.” Beneath the headline, a persona-specific subheading appears, followed by an animated bar visualization comparing diagnosed versus undiagnosed dementia or ADHD overdiagnosis. A soft call to action invites visitors to download the “2025 Cognitive Assessment Evidence Pack” by opening the email-capture modal.

Scrolling down reveals the detection gap section on a two-column layout. The left side shows a concise narrative about underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in three to four sentences, and the right side features an interactive chart with tabs for Dementia, ADHD, and Traditional vs Digital comparisons. An inline call to action here prompts download of the “9-Point Cognitive Diagnostic Risk Checklist.” Further down, the “Tool Lens” section lets users toggle between paper tests, single-purpose ADHD tools, and clinical impressions to see side-by-side columns of “What you get” versus “What you miss.” A simple pipeline diagram below those columns illustrates how current processes lead to delayed or missed diagnoses.

Continuing in the main content, the day-in-the-life section displays a two-mode timeline that contrasts “Before digital” and “With digital cognitive assessment” workflows for the selected persona. Timeline steps can be expanded to reveal one or two sentences of explanation. Each persona timeline concludes with an embedded CTA to view a sample report for that role. Next, the outcomes dashboard is presented as a grid of metric cards tagged by domain. Visitors can click tags labeled All, Dementia, ADHD, Operations, or Research to filter the cards instantly. Each card highlights a major statistic, one line of context, and one line describing what it means for the user, followed by a button to download the Clinical Outcomes Pack.

Below the metrics, the ROI and implementation sandbox houses a mini ROI calculator and a 90-day implementation checklist. The calculator features sliders for cognitive-related visits per month, current and target screening rates, and average incremental revenue per case. Adjusting these inputs immediately updates output fields showing extra billable services per year and clinician/staff time saved. Under the calculator, a persona-specific four-phase checklist displays checkboxes for tasks in Weeks 1–2, 3–4, 5–8, and 9–12. Visitors can enter an email to receive the 90-day plan as a PDF. Finally, at the bottom of the page, four persona-aligned CTA cards offer a primary download asset and a secondary sales action for Primary Care, Neurology, Mental Health / ADHD, and Corporate Wellness.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the visitor makes a persona selection using the sticky selector, JavaScript updates all subsequent sections in place. No full page reload occurs; instead, text nodes and chart data are swapped dynamically. Clicking the hero CTA fades in an email-capture modal overlay. Entering an email and clicking submit triggers client-side validation. If the input is valid, the modal content flips to show the download link. If invalid, an inline error message appears beneath the input field until corrected. Closing the modal returns the user to the scroll position they were at.

In the detection gap chart, tapping each tab updates the bar visualization and accompanying label text. Hovering or tapping bars reveals tooltips with exact numbers. The inline CTA in that section behaves identically to the hero CTA. The Tool Lens toggle functions similarly: selecting each tool option triggers a smooth content swap between “What you get” and “What you miss” columns, while the pipeline diagram remains static. 

The day-in-the-life timeline uses a toggle control at the top of the section to switch between “Before digital” and “With digital assessment.” Each timeline event displays a label by default, and clicking the label expands it to reveal more detail in a slide-down animation. Expanding a step does not collapse other steps automatically; users can expand multiple steps to compare notes. The embedded CTA in this section opens the email-capture modal as in previous flows.

In the outcomes dashboard, clicking any tag applies a filter by updating the grid via client-side filtering of a JSON array loaded at page initialization. Cards that do not match the selected tag fade out, and matching cards fade in. The “Clinical Outcomes Pack” CTA functions like other CTAs. In the ROI calculator, moving any slider or changing any numeric input fields instantly recomputes results using the formulas defined in the local JSON configuration. Below, checking or unchecking items in the 90-day plan checklist changes their style to indicate completion. Submitting the plan via the email form triggers the same modal workflow and sends an email with the PDF attached or linked. 

Finally, the persona cards at the bottom each contain their own download and secondary CTAs. Clicking the primary button for any card opens the email modal. Clicking the secondary button navigates the user to a calendar-booking widget hosted on an external page. That external page opens in a new tab, while the original report page remains in place.

## Settings and Account Management
This application does not offer user accounts or settings pages. Personalization applies only to the current browsing session and resets if the page is refreshed or reopened. There are no user profiles, no notification preferences, and no persistent data storage beyond ephemeral form inputs. All lead magnet requests rely on email capture only.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the static JSON configuration fails to load at page initialization—for example, due to network issues—a fallback message appears in each interactive section explaining that data is temporarily unavailable. The hero and CTA sections default to plain text links to download a generic PDF stored at a known URL. In form modals, invalid email formats trigger inline error messages instructing the user to enter a valid address. If the email submission endpoint returns an error, a retry prompt appears with an option to reenter the email or try again later. Interactive chart or toggle controls that rely on JavaScript gracefully degrade to show only the first tab or first toggle option as static text.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A visitor begins by landing on the report page via marketing channels or direct links. They immediately select their persona using the sticky selector, which personalizes headlines, visuals, and CTAs without reloading. They scroll through the hero, detection gap, and Tool Lens sections, interacting with animated charts and toggles. At any point, they can download gated PDFs by entering an email address in a modal. In the day-in-the-life section, they compare workflows before and after digital assessment, expanding events for detail and viewing a sample report. The outcomes grid demonstrates proof points, and they use the ROI calculator and 90-day plan checklist to model value and implementation steps. Finally, they choose a persona card to download a final asset or book a workflow review. Throughout the journey, each interactive element connects seamlessly to the next, guiding the visitor from initial hook to meaningful engagement and resource download.
